        <h2>WELCOME TO FIRST YEAR PLAYERS!!</h2>
        <p>First Year Players (FYP) is Syracuse University’s largest student-run organization, dedicated to giving first-year and transfer students the chance to perform in a musical.

        <p>Founded in 1992, FYP has become one of SU’s most beloved traditions. Our organization is unique in its ability to produce an annual musical production while stimulating bonding between older members of the organization, called staff. Every fall and spring semester, our members collaborate to produce events that showcase creativity, teamwork, and the FYP spirit.</p>
