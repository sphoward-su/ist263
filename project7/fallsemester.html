      <p>The fall semester sets the stage for everything First Year Players does throughout the year, serving as the foundation for both personal growth and creative collaboration. It’s a time for new members to meet one another, build lasting friendships, and begin developing the skills that will carry them through the spring musical process. Through meetings, workshops, and social events, first years are introduced to the unique culture of FYP—one rooted in creativity, inclusivity, and support. By the end of the fall, members feel confident, connected, and ready to take on the exciting challenges ahead as part of the FYP family.</p>

      <p class="fall-align">Each first-year member is paired with an upperclass staffer through FYP’s Mentor/Mentee Program, providing guidance and support throughout the year. Mentors help answer questions, offer advice on auditions and college life, and serve as a reliable resource within the organization. This program strengthens the sense of community within FYP and ensures that first years feel welcomed, supported, and connected from the start.</p>
