   <p> 
        My name is Spencer Howard and I am from Haddon Township, NJ. I am currently a junior, 
        dual majoring in Public Relations and Policy Studies in Newhouse and Maxwell, respectively. 
        I am also minoring in Information Management and Technology in the iSchool. I have an 
        interest in doing political campaign consulting and possibly attending law school upon 
        graduating from SU. I am also interested in working as a publicist in film, music, and TV 
        shows.
