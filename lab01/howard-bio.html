</head>

<body>
    My name is Spencer Howard and I am from Haddon Township, NJ. I am currently a junior, dual majoring in Public Relations and Policy Studies in Newhouse and Maxwell, respectively. I am also minoring in Information Management and Technology in the iSchool. I have an interest in doing political campaign consulting and possibly attending law school upon graduating from SU. I am also interested in working as a publicist in film, music, and TV shows. 

In terms of accomplishments, I am at SU on its highest scholarship offered called the Coronat Scholarship. I have skills in social media content creation, public relations writing, journalism, public policy analysis, and data analytics. 

Outside of an academic and professional setting, I enjoy playing tennis, seeing concerts and live theater, socializing with friends, and traveling to new places. On campus, Iâ€™m involved in a theater organization called FYP, The Daily Orange, a community service club called OrangeSeeds, and many other things. I am also an Honors RA in Sadler Hall. My favorite television shows are Shameless and How To Get Away With Murder, while my favorite movie of all time is Almost Famous.
